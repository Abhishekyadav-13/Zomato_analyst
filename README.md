Project Objective

This project aims to analyze and visualize key business insights from a dataset using a combination of MySQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. The objective is to leverage these tools to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, presenting a comprehensive understanding of the dataset for decision-making purposes.

Tools & Technologies MySQL: Used for data extraction, transformation, and running complex queries to perform detailed analysis of the data. Excel: Utilized for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and creating summary statistics. Pivot tables and charts were employed to provide quick insights. Power BI: Power BI dashboards were developed to visualize KPIs and trends in an interactive way, allowing users to drill down into key metrics. Tableau: Tableau dashboards were created to provide additional visualizations that highlight trends, distribution, and outliers in the dataset. Key Features SQL Queries: Structured queries were written to extract and filter relevant information from the dataset. This included operations like aggregations, joins, and subqueries to answer specific business questions.

Excel Dashboard: An interactive Excel dashboard was created with pivot tables and charts, offering a snapshot of the datasetâ€™s key statistics, such as totals, averages, and performance indicators.

Power BI Dashboard: A dynamic dashboard that focuses on visualizing KPIs like total sales, customer demographics, and geographical distribution. It includes the ability to filter and slice data by different categories.

Tableau Dashboard: The Tableau dashboard provides further visualizations to uncover patterns and trends in the data, including heatmaps, bar charts, and geographical mappings for location-based analysis.
